Scrapes disease-associated miRNA data.

Databases of miRNA-disease association, like
[HMDD](http://www.cuilab.cn/hmdd) or
[miRTarBase](http://mirtarbase.cuhk.edu.cn/php/), provide easily
downloadable data dumps, but no easy way to query it programmatically,
such as an API, this package exists to alleviate some of those issues.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of miRminer from Github with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("jvfe/miRminer")
```
